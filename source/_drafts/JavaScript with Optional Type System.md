title: JavaScript with Optional Type System
tags:
---

## Attempts

- [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Flow](http://flowtype.org/)
- [SoundScript](https://developers.google.com/v8/experiments#soundscript)

All of them are opt-ins for JavaScript, which means all our existing code bases can be reused.
As of 2015.08, TypeScript is the most stable and feature-complete one.
This presentation will focus on TypeScript and its tooling.

## Intro

- TypeScript, by Microsoft, is a superset of JavaScript, implements optional type system for JavaScript. It has a prosperous community callled [DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/);
- Flow, by Facebook, is a static type checker for JavaScript whose syntax is very similar to TypeScript but extends it;
- SoundScript is a proposal by Google, which was promised to be experimented in V8 engine.

## Why Static Type?

- Better static code analysis, which leads to:
    + Better intellisense
    + Find out potential bugs during compilation
- Communicate with backend
